# Rylvo — Brutalist AI Support Infrastructure

Rylvo is not a chatbot builder.  
It's a new **support protocol for the internet.**

→ One prompt = live bot + public link + embed code  
→ Zero setup. No dev time. No CRM.  
→ Built for startups, D2C brands, and trillion-dollar companies alike.

---

## 💥 Core Concept

> "Prompt → Bot → Link"  
> That's it.

Rylvo lets any brand create a support bot in seconds — no training, no flows, no dashboards.  
Just type what your company does. Rylvo handles the rest.

Every brand gets:
- A public, verified support link (`rylvo.support/yourbrand`)  
- A WhatsApp-like chat experience — global, fast, no login  
- Instant escalation fallback (AI fails → human takeover)

## 🧠 Core USPs (Based on Your Map)

- ✅ **Scam-Proof Verified Support**  
  Brands get verified URLs. No more fake numbers or impersonators.

- ✅ **One Platform to Support Every Brand**  
  Rylvo is to support what Gmail is to email. A global access layer.

- ✅ **Instant Bot Creation**  
  One prompt = full support bot. GPT powers 90% of use cases.

- ✅ **Smart Escalation System**  
  If bot fails → escalate to fallback agent live. No dead ends.

- ✅ **No Integration Needed**  
  Just paste one line of HTML or use our public chat link. That's it.

- ✅ **Minimal, Brutalist UX**  
  No loaders, avatars, or BS. Just chat. UI cuts deeper than Slack.

- ✅ **No Login Experience**  
  Users just click and start. Like Telegram for brand support.

- ✅ **Universal Public Directory**  
  Users can search any brand and chat from one trusted place.

- ✅ **Massive Network Flywheel**  
  More brands → more users → more visibility → infinite loop.
